*A visual representation of clustering in action.*

This repository contains a demonstration of clustering medical health records using Natural Language Processing (NLP). By leveraging techniques like TF-IDF for vectorization and KMeans for clustering, we aim to categorize similar health records, offering a glimpse into potential insights and patterns in medical data.

## Features

- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Convert medical records into numerical vectors that capture the semantic essence of each record.
- **KMeans Clustering**: Categorize medical records into distinct clusters based on their content.
- **PCA Visualization**: 2D visualization of clusters, providing a spatial representation of the dataset.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/junaidjmomin/MediClusterNLP.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd MediClusterNLP
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python medical_record_demo.py
   ```

2. View the visualization and clustering results in the terminal.

## Methodology

### Data Vectorization

Medical records are converted into numerical vectors using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) technique. This method emphasizes the importance of specific terms in each record relative to their occurrence in the entire dataset.

### Clustering

KMeans clustering categorizes the vectorized records into distinct groups. For this demo, we've chosen two clusters, but this can be adjusted based on the nature and variety of the dataset.

### Visualization

Post clustering, we employ PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for dimensionality reduction, allowing us to visualize the clusters in a 2D space. Each point in the visualization represents a medical record, and the color denotes the cluster it belongs to.

## Future Work

- **Expand Dataset**: Incorporate a larger, real-world dataset for more meaningful clustering results.
- **Advanced Vectorization**: Explore word embeddings like Word2Vec or FastText for richer semantic representation.
- **Alternative Clustering Methods**: Experiment with density-based clustering methods like DBSCAN or HDBSCAN.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Integrate tools like Plotly or Bokeh for interactive cluster visualization.

## Project Benefits

*Efficient Data Organization*: By clustering medical health records, the project aids in organizing vast amounts of medical data into coherent and meaningful groups. This can make it easier for healthcare professionals to access and analyze related health records.

*Insight Discovery*: Categorizing similar health records can reveal patterns, trends, and anomalies in medical data. These insights could be crucial for medical research, diagnosis, treatment planning, and public health initiatives.

*Semantic Understanding*: The use of TF-IDF for vectorization captures the semantic essence of each medical record. This ensures that the records are not just grouped based on superficial similarities but on deeper, contextually relevant content.

*Flexibility*: The project uses KMeans clustering, which is adjustable. Depending on the nature and variety of the dataset, the number of clusters can be changed, offering flexibility in data categorization.

*Visual Representation*: The PCA visualization offers a spatial representation of the dataset. This can be invaluable for stakeholders who need a visual understanding of how medical records relate to each other.

*Scalability and Future Expansion*: The project's methodology is designed to accommodate future enhancements, such as the incorporation of larger datasets, exploration of advanced vectorization techniques, and integration of interactive visualization tools.

*Open for Collaboration*: With an emphasis on contributions and an open-source license, the project promotes community collaboration, ensuring continuous improvement and the integration of diverse expertise.

*Enhanced Patient Care*: In a practical setting, understanding patterns in medical records can aid in predictive healthcare, identifying potential outbreaks, understanding patient history better, and ultimately enhancing patient care.

*Research and Development*: Such projects can be foundational for academic and pharmaceutical research. Grouping similar health issues or treatments can lead to more targeted research studies.

*Data Privacy*: By working with vectorized data representations instead of raw medical records, there's an added layer of data abstraction, which can be a step towards ensuring patient privacy.
