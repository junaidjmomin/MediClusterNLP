*A visual representation of clustering in action.*

This repository contains a demonstration of clustering medical health records using Natural Language Processing (NLP). By leveraging techniques like TF-IDF for vectorization and KMeans for clustering, we aim to categorize similar health records, offering a glimpse into potential insights and patterns in medical data.

## Features

- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Convert medical records into numerical vectors that capture the semantic essence of each record.
- **KMeans Clustering**: Categorize medical records into distinct clusters based on their content.
- **PCA Visualization**: 2D visualization of clusters, providing a spatial representation of the dataset.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/junaidjmomin/Medical-Record-Clustering-NLP-Demo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Medical-Record-Clustering-NLP-Demo
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python medical_record_demo.py
   ```

2. View the visualization and clustering results in the terminal.

## Methodology

### Data Vectorization

Medical records are converted into numerical vectors using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) technique. This method emphasizes the importance of specific terms in each record relative to their occurrence in the entire dataset.

### Clustering

KMeans clustering categorizes the vectorized records into distinct groups. For this demo, we've chosen two clusters, but this can be adjusted based on the nature and variety of the dataset.

### Visualization

Post clustering, we employ PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for dimensionality reduction, allowing us to visualize the clusters in a 2D space. Each point in the visualization represents a medical record, and the color denotes the cluster it belongs to.

## Future Work

- **Expand Dataset**: Incorporate a larger, real-world dataset for more meaningful clustering results.
- **Advanced Vectorization**: Explore word embeddings like Word2Vec or FastText for richer semantic representation.
- **Alternative Clustering Methods**: Experiment with density-based clustering methods like DBSCAN or HDBSCAN.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Integrate tools like Plotly or Bokeh for interactive cluster visualization.
